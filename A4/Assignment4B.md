**Problem Statement**  
  
Carbon Dioxide emissions are the primary human-generated cause of Climate Change and Global Warming. Climate Change, with the melting of the ice at both the North and South Poles, is endangering island and coastal communities, who may see their homes swept away into the sea. People have adapted by supporting renewable energy sources for local powergrids and homes, as well as adopting vehicles that use electricty in some way. By mapping carbon dioxide output over time in developing countries, we are able to develop methods to reduce the rate at which carbon dioxide emissions increases, and by adding a predictive element to the model, we are able to project future carbon dioxide emissions by 100x100 meter spaces.  
  
Thus, how can we use CO2 detection and prediction algorithms to project future emissions from developing countries onto a map with a high enough resolution to understand how and where CO2 is currently being produced and where it will spread.
