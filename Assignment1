  In most countries, the car is the epitome of mobility. Not in Vietnam. In the inner city of Hanoi, Vietnam, the primary mode of transport is not the automobile, but rather the motorbike (referring to two-wheeled motorized vehicles, such as motorcycles and scooters). In 1996, there were 4 million motorbikes in Vietnam, and by 2016, there are 43 million, with 4 million alone in the capitol and about 470 motorbikes per 1000 people. The article seeks to address the lack of attention given to motorbikes in automobility theory, as well as bringing attention to current developments and capabilities of people in auto- and motomobility in Vietnam. These motorbikes are the basis for modern Hanoian mobility and mobility culture rather than the car due to the relatively low initial costs of motorbikes, as well as savings due to how motorcycles not needing as much parking space/needing dedicated parking space, being taxed less than cars, and not requiring a driver's license. This, alongside Hanoi's narrow roads and underdeveloped public transportation system, have seen to the dominance of the motorbikes in the city. The automobile, on the other hand, is made much more of a status symbol than before, thanks to the aforementioned costs; the symbolization of the car is the culmination of Vietnamese efforts to transition to a market economy, as it is something one can flaunt around in the city and in the que (village, as many who live in Hanoi came from the countryside) to show their success, and in the case of businessmen, trustworthiness to future business partners. However, the car is currently being normalized as a proper means of transport rather than an accessory to reveal to others in order to illustrate one's success due to increasing wealth in the country.
  With regards to Amartya Sen's definition of human development, this article specifically relates to social opportunities, as it discusses the social context of the motorbike in Vietnam, specifically how motorbikes can be seen as an extra pair of proverbial legs for the city denizens of Vietnam, as well as how there exists a divide between the car-owning and non-car-owning people of Vietnam, where those who use cars receive generally preferencial treatment (when they use their car to go to places in the city, anyhow) to those who primarily use motorcycles. The author, rather than use geospacial datasets, chooses to instead reference other articles and participate in and interview other participators of this motomobility-focused society.
