Perspective Question for Today:

Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls, and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.

Additionally, consider the following statements from classmates:

"Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences." - Anna Raymond.

"Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data-based issues & human-based issues) could lead to better results." - Nira Nair

"In lieu of such drastic poptential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." - Kayla Seggeike

How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency", and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science?

Prepare response for next Thursday's class.

Here are my responses from the Blumenstock article:

Blumenstock cites the promise of being able to give everyone and anyone a credit score, allowing them to borrow money, even if they'd be traditionally be barred from borrowing due to lack of "collateral or access to a bank" (Blumenstock 2018), through machine learning algorithms and cellphone tracking data to track daily purchases, as well as helping direct government aid, keep tabs on poverty, and keep tabs on agricultural output through the same methods.

However, he also cites that there exist issues with this system, mainly in algorithmic and data bias, where most of the data comes from a country's wealthiest, as well as misuse of this system by banks and individuals.
