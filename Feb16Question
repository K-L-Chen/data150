Development is the expansion of freedoms (Page 14). These freedoms are: freedom to survive, freedom of political and social expression, and freedom of economy. These freedoms, and the importance they have to this definition of development, are the basis of the author's thesis, namely how more democratic countries are generally more developed, and are better equipped to withstand certain disasters such as famine.

This is very much an expansive view of development as a concept, as it expands development from only including strictly physical and objective statistics, such as child mortality rates, population distribution, and infrastructure, to one including more abstract concepts, namely freedoms and if they are being enjoyed by the population of a country.

Sources of unfreedoms, that is, freedoms that are not in total or complete practice, in certain countries depends on the state of said country. For example, survival unfreedom, that is the lack of freedom to survive, encapsulates famines, undernutrition, "lack of access to health care, sanitation, functional education, and social security", and lack of gender equality. Other unfreedoms are less broad, political unfreedom is the lacking of free speech, freedom to vote, and freedom to run for election, social unfreedom is the lack of social equality, gender, racial, or otherwise, and economic unfreedom is the lacking of the ability to choose what to purchase. Sources of survival unfreedom can be attributed to corruption, lack of infrastructure, and is related to lack of political unfreedom. Political unfreedom generally stems from either an authoritarian regime or, in rarer cases, the suppression of a group by another, creating social unfreedoms.
