Development is the expansion of freedoms (Page 14). These freedoms are: freedom to survive, freedom of political and social expression, and freedom of economy. These freedoms, and the importance they have to this definition of development, are the basis of the author's thesis, namely how more democratic countries are generally more developed, and are better equipped to withstand certain disasters such as famine.

This is very much an expansive view of development as a concept, as it expands development from only including strictly physical and objective statistics, such as child mortality rates, population distribution, and infrastructure, to one including more abstract concepts, namely freedoms and if they are being enjoyed by the population of a country.
