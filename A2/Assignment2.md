  **Introduction**  
  
    South East Asia was, during the age of colonialism, a primarily bicycle-riding society. The bicycle was, for all intents and purposes, the car of the region, and it transformed life such that semi-suburban neighborhoods sprung up on the outskirts of cities like Hanoi, and many subjects under the colonial authority sprung up to supplement the demand for this everyday commodity. In fact, by 1926, there were an estimated 50,000 Bicycles in the Cholon Quarter of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), and in Hanoi, the bicycle was fast becoming a standard mode of transport. The economic importance of the bicycle was held in such high regard that, as can be seen with the development of mobile shops and bicycle-rickshaw taxis, the people of South East Asia tailored the mobility tool to their own needs, and local bicycle makers and mechanics were able to withstand the economic downturn of the Great Depression due to the high demand of bicycles for their added mobility (Arnold & DeWald, 2012).
