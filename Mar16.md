1.  How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?  
    a. Barder defines development as a property of the economic and social systems, rather than specifically the sum of improvements for people. He states that development is an emergent property of the economy, where the more developed countries have a more complex system that better supports its citizens.  
2. Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010.  Why did he make this comparison?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate economic models?  
    a. Both South Korea and Ghana during the 1960s were extremely poor, with economic growth rates extremely low. However, by the mid-1970s, the South Korean economy begins pick up steam and accelerates its own economic growth, while Ghana has only just began to increase its economic grouth in a way such that a noticable shift can be seen on the graph by 2006. While there still exists poverty and the working poor in South Korea, the whole of South Korean society shifted from a primarily agrarian economy to a primarily industrial, urban economy, changing the nearly everyone in the country.  
3. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?  
    a. The toaster project was a project by an Thomas Thwaites to create a homemade toaster from the ground up with raw materials. He was, in his own words, "partially successful", as his toaster __did__ work, if only for a few seconds before bursting into flame. The significance of this example is to show that even small, economically insignificant objects are nearly impossible to craft-product reliably, and that the complexity of the economic system has led to the inevitable ubiquity of the object in question. Thus, the homemade toaster, which was entirely craft-produced, took 9 months to complete, required Thwaites to turn raw materials into parts for his toaster, as well as having to melt-down existing items back into raw materials, and didn't work for long enough to be useful.
