- Blumenstock cites the promise of being able to give everyone and anyone a credit score, allowing them to borrow money, even if they'd be traditionally be barred from borrowing due to lack of "collateral or access to a bank" (Blumenstock 2018), through machine learning algorithms and cellphone tracking data to track daily purchases, as well as helping direct government aid, keep tabs on poverty, and keep tabs on agricultural output through the same methods.

- However, he also cites that there exist issues with this system, mainly in algorithmic and data bias, where most of the data comes from a country's wealthiest, as well as misuse of this system by banks and individuals, and instead proposes that these systems be customizable for specific purposes, such as mapping poverty, as well as stating that the algorithms should be validated by existing methods. Blumenstock also proposes that data scientists should collaborate with both local governments and international corporations, and everyone in-between, as to foster more development within the sector.

- With regards to "good intent" in dealing with problems that "determine people's experiences," it's important to note that in history, concepts and objects made with the best intentions could be used in a terrible way, and inversely, concepts and objects made with the worst intentions could end up being used in a good way. As such, developers must be privy not only to the ways one obtains data, but also the way one can anonymize it.

- With regards to "transparency," there seems to be a lack of proper transparency with the information sharing economy of today. Big Tech corporations and companies, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others, tend to not have any transparency with regards to what data is being shared, where the data is being shared to, and who the data can be seen by. In the worse case, some may lie about not selling your data and do it anyway.

- As for a "balancing act", it's all about control of information. Governments, corporations, and individuals have to be able to keep the other two in check. In the best case scenario, it all of the data, if consented to being given, would be open source for everyone.
